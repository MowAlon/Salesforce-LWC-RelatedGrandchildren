# Salesforce-LWC-RelatedGrandchildren
A Lightning Web Component used to display a full list of related records which are related through more than one generation

The standard Related List component only allows you to show records that are direct children of the current record. This component allows you to go as deep as Salesforce allows (which I believe is five levels deeper than the current record).

In this screenshot, we see all the Opportunity Products related to all the Opportunities related to this Account.
